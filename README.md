# What is a Single Linked List
A Single Linked List is a collection of data that is meant to be traveled from the first node or first node to the last node. <br>
Nodes are the data contained in each positions of the List. What makes it "Single" is that it can only be traveled one way.

#Project Premise
The project is about using these Single Linked List and transforming it into new linked lists. the purpose is to be Recursive, which means to reverse <br>
the linked lsit to go the opposite direction. Which means what we thought of as the first node is the last node, and the last node is the first node.
